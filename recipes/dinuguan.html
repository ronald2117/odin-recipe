        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pork dinuguan or pork blood stew is a Filipino dish simmered in a rich mixture of vinegar, pig's blood and pork belly.

            This Filipino dish is an acquired taste and is usually paired with rice or puto (rice cake). Pork belly is usually used but you may also use pork shoulder. Brown the pork before tenderizing it in vinegar, bay leaf, and pig's blood. Make sure pig's blood is completely cooked and stir continuously, so the sauce won't burn as it simmers. </p>
